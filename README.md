# Adoption
This project is an exploration of ES6modules, JSON and XHRrequest. The application is about pets adoption. It displays 30 pets cards. As a user, I can see 3 category(type) buttons printed at the top of the page. When you click one of the 3 buttons, then only the cards that are in the category(type)will show.
